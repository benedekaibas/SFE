“My work celebrates sensuality, vulnerability and femininity. I aim to challenge and re-imagine a classical depiction of beauty by celebrating marginalized bodies.” —@sarennya (Sarennya)⁣

“I do what I do for the fat, brown, queer girlies out there. I hope by engaging in my work it challenges people’s ideas of beauty and inspires them to see the strength in their own femininity,” says the Brooklyn-based, Malaysian-born model and stylist.⁣

“I attribute my love of all things shining, shimmering, splendid to being raised as a Malaysian in such a vibrant culture! I also believe fashion and creativity are about play, so I love the freedom to experiment and try new combinations with the way I dress. It’s as much a method of expression as it is about self-discovery.⁣
 ⁣
My work as a model has always been about being the representation I wish I had growing up. Images of people like me living full, happy lives make it harder to sell the lie that we’re deserving of any less.”
