“I draw girls who are cool, carefree and just a little bit spirited.” —Japanese illustrator and artist @monyochita (Monyochita Pomichi)
 
Monyochita’s array of characters, including “MONYO GIRL” and “Gyoza-chan,” are rendered through drawings, paintings, stickers and soft vinyl figures.
 
“The girls that I draw always have a ‘straight face,’ inspired by the genuine facial expressions of children. I would be happy if the viewers could interpret the emotions in their own way.
 
I want my art to go beyond kawaii. I would be happy if you could catch a hint of fun and a slightly twisted feeling from my work.”
